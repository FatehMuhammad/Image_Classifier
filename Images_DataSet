Images DataSet have been uploaded on Google Drive, below is the link to download DataSet. DataSet includes TrainData.csv ( You have to split it into 75% training and 25% testing. This percentage can be different according to your choice.). Trainlabels.csv is also given.
P.S. TestData.csv file was given to me by the instructor to check accuracy of my models. This was just for evaluation purposes, and labels were not given.
